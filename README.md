# Bouncy Ball
This is a simple ball game created in C++ using SFML. 

## Instructions
The ball will bounce around the screen, deflecting off of the edges of the screen and bouncing when the space bar is hit.

## Goal
The goal of the project is to demonstrate object oriented programming and git programming skills as well as use and learn the SFML library for GUI design and basic game development.

## Organization
In one main loop, an SFML window renders objects (stored as local instances of objects defined in other C++ files). 

## To-Do
* Add hoops
* Add points
* Add obstacles
* Add Coins
* Change Textures
